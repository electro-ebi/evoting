- **Smart Contracts**: Automated election management and vote processing
- **Transparent Audit Trail**: Complete history of all voting activities
- **Tamper-Proof Results**: Results cannot be modified once recorded

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features
- **Proof of Work**: Mining difficulty ensures blockchain security
- **Hash Chaining**: Each block contains the hash of the previous block
- **Digital Signatures**: Vote transactions are cryptographically signed
- **Decentralized Verification**: Multiple verification layers
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Automated election rules enforcement

## Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. Blockchain Core (`blockchain/Blockchain.js`)
```javascript
class Blockchain {
  constructor() {
    this.chain = [this.createGenesisBlock()];
    this.difficulty = 2;
    this.pendingVotes = [];
  }
  
  // Core blockchain functions
  createVote(from, to, candidateId, electionId, userId)
  minePendingVotes(miningRewardAddress)
  getElectionResults(electionId)
  isChainValid()
}
```

#### 2. Smart Contracts (`blockchain/SmartContract.js`)
```javascript
class SmartContract {
  // Election management
  deployElectionContract(electionId, title, description, startDate, endDate, candidates)
  addCandidate(electionId, candidateId, name, party)
  castVote(electionId, candidateId, userId, voterAddress)
  getElectionResults(electionId)
  endElection(electionId)
}
```

#### 3. Blockchain Service (`blockchain/BlockchainService.js`)
```javascript
class BlockchainService {
  // High-level blockchain operations
  initializeBlockchain()
  deployElectionContract(electionData)
  castVoteOnBlockchain(voteData)
  getElectionResultsFromBlockchain(electionId)
  getBlockchainStatistics()
}
```

  electionId={electionId} 
  showDetails={true} 
/>
```

**Features:**
- Real-time blockchain status display

## Integration Points

### 1. Election Creation
When an admin creates an election:
1. Election is saved to database
2. Smart contract is deployed on blockchain
3. Contract address is generated
4. Election becomes blockchain-secured

### 2. Candidate Addition
When candidates are added:
1. Candidate is saved to database
2. Candidate is added to smart contract
3. Contract is updated with new candidate
4. Changes are recorded on blockchain

### 3. Vote Casting
When a user casts a vote:
1. Vote is saved to database
2. Vote is recorded on blockchain
3. Smart contract processes the vote
4. Transaction hash is generated
5. Vote becomes immutable

### 4. Results Display
When viewing results:
1. Database results are fetched
2. Blockchain results are verified
3. Integrity is checked
4. Transparent audit trail is shown

## Security Implementation

### Hash Verification
```javascript
calculateHash() {
  return crypto
    .createHash("sha256")
    .update(
      this.previousHash +
      this.timestamp +
      JSON.stringify(this.data) +
      this.nonce
    )
    .digest("hex");
}
```

### Proof of Work
```javascript
mineBlock(difficulty) {
  const target = Array(difficulty + 1).join("0");
  while (this.hash.substring(0, difficulty) !== target) {
    this.nonce++;
    this.hash = this.calculateHash();
  }
}
```

### Smart Contract Validation
```javascript
castVote(electionId, candidateId, userId, voterAddress) {
  // Check election status
  // Verify voting period
  // Prevent double voting
  // Record vote immutably
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Initialize Blockchain (Admin)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/blockchain/initialize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>"
```

### 2. Deploy Election Contract
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/blockchain/elections/deploy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "election-123",
    "title": "Student Council Election",
    "description": "Annual student council election",
    "startDate": "2024-01-01",
    "endDate": "2024-01-31"
  }'
```

### 3. Cast Vote
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/blockchain/vote \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <user-token>" \
