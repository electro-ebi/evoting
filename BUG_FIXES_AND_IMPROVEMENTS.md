## üîß Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. **Blockchain Sync Issue - FIXED** ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Votes cast through the website weren't automatically syncing to the blockchain
- Manual sync script worked, but real-time voting required manual intervention
- Blockchain statistics didn't update automatically

**Root Cause:**
- Blockchain service wasn't initialized when the server started
- Missing blockchain fields in Vote model

**Solution:**
1. Created `initBlockchain.js` to initialize blockchain service on startup
2. Updated `server.js` to call initialization function
3. Added missing blockchain fields to Vote model:
   - `blockchainBlockHash`
   - `blockchainBlockNumber`
4. Enhanced `blockchainSync.js` middleware with:
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Detailed blockchain operation tracking
   - Manual sync function export
   - Automatic retry mechanisms

**Files Modified:**
- `/evoting-backend/initBlockchain.js` (NEW)
- `/evoting-backend/server.js`
- `/evoting-backend/models/Vote.js`
- `/evoting-backend/middleware/blockchainSync.js`

**Testing:**
```bash
# Backend should show on startup:
üîó Initializing blockchain service...
‚úÖ Blockchain service initialized
üìä Initial blockchain stats: ...
üöÄ Blockchain service ready

# When voting:
üîÑ [Blockchain Sync] Starting sync for vote {id}...
‚úÖ [Blockchain Sync] Vote {id} successfully recorded on blockchain
```

  video: {
    width: { ideal: isMobile ? 480 : 640 },
    height: { ideal: isMobile ? 360 : 480 },
    facingMode: 'user', // Front camera
    frameRate: { ideal: isMobile ? 15 : 24 }
  }
};

// Detection interval adapts to device
const interval = isMobile ? 200 : 100; // ms

// Smaller input size for mobile
inputSize: isMobile ? 224 : 416
```

## üîê Security Enhancements

### 3. **Face Descriptor Validation**

**Improvements:**
- Validate descriptor length (must be 128 dimensions)
- Calculate face quality based on variance
- Multi-algorithm similarity comparison:
  - Euclidean distance (40% weight)
  - Cosine similarity (40% weight)
  - Manhattan distance (20% weight)
- Configurable threshold (default: 0.6)

**Backend Validation:**
```javascript
// faceVerificationController.js
if (faceDescriptor.length !== 128) {
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    success: false,
    message: 'Invalid face descriptor length. Expected 128 dimensions.'
  });
}
```

## üöÄ How to Test

### 1. Test Backend Blockchain Sync

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd evoting-web/evoting-backend
npm start

# Should see:
# üîó Initializing blockchain service...
# ‚úÖ Blockchain service initialized
# üöÄ Blockchain service ready
```

### 2. Test Face Registration (Desktop)

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/face-registration
2. Grant camera permissions
3. Position face in frame
4. Wait for "Face Detected" indicator
5. Check quality meter (should be >50%)
6. Click "Capture & Register"
7. Verify success message

### 3. Test Face Registration (Mobile)

1. Get network IP: `ip addr show | grep inet`
2. Navigate to http://[YOUR_IP]:3000/face-registration on mobile
3. Grant camera permissions (iOS may require HTTPS)
4. Follow same steps as desktop
5. Verify mobile UI is responsive
6. Check touch controls work

### 4. Test Voting with Blockchain Sync

1. Login to the system
2. Navigate to an active election
3. Cast a vote
4. Check backend console for blockchain sync logs
5. Verify vote appears in blockchain statistics
6. Check database for `blockchainTxHash`, `blockchainBlockHash`, and `blockchainBlockNumber`

### 5. Test Face Verification During Voting

1. Register face first (see steps above)
2. Navigate to secure voting page
3. Face verification should trigger automatically
4. Position face in camera
5. Wait for verification success
6. Proceed to cast vote

## üìã Database Schema Updates

### Vote Model
```sql
ALTER TABLE votes ADD COLUMN blockchainBlockHash VARCHAR(66);
ALTER TABLE votes ADD COLUMN blockchainBlockNumber INTEGER;
```

**Note:** These fields will be created automatically by Sequelize when the server starts.

## üîç Known Issues & Limitations

### Camera Access on iOS
- **Issue:** iOS Safari requires HTTPS for camera access
- **Workaround:** Use network IP with self-signed certificate or test on Android
- **Future Fix:** Set up proper HTTPS in development

### Face Detection Performance
- **Issue:** May be slower on older mobile devices
- **Mitigation:** Reduced frame rate and smaller input size for mobile
- **Future Fix:** Implement progressive enhancement based on device capability

### Model Loading
- **Issue:** First load may take 2-3 seconds to download models
- **Mitigation:** Models cached after first load
- **Future Fix:** Implement service worker for offline caching

## üì± Mobile Browser Compatibility

### Tested Browsers
- ‚úÖ Chrome (Android 10+)
- ‚úÖ Firefox (Android 10+)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Safari (iOS 14+) - Requires HTTPS
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Samsung Internet - Works but may need permissions twice

### Recommended Setup for Mobile Testing
```bash
# 1. Find your network IP
ip addr show | grep "inet "

# 2. Update CORS in server.js (already done)
# 3. Access from mobile: http://[YOUR_IP]:3000
# 4. For iOS, set up HTTPS or use ngrok:
npx ngrok http 3000
```
