# Check your face status:
curl http://localhost:5000/api/face-auth/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Database Check
```bash
# Check votes have blockchain hashes:
# Look in your database
# votes table should have:
# - blockchainTxHash
# - blockchainBlockHash  
# - blockchainBlockNumber
```

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Blockchain Not Syncing?
**Check backend console for:**
```
✅ [Blockchain Sync] Vote X successfully recorded
```

**If not appearing:**
1. Restart backend: `npm start` in evoting-backend/
2. Check logs for errors
3. Verify vote was created in database

### Face Detection Not Working?
**Common fixes:**
1. Good lighting on your face
2. Face camera directly
3. Remove glasses/hat
4. Try Chrome browser
5. Clear cache and reload

### Mobile Can't Connect?
**Verify:**
1. Same WiFi network?
2. Correct IP address?
3. Backend running?
4. Firewall allowing ports 3000 & 5000?

**Fix firewall:**
```bash
sudo ufw allow 3000
sudo ufw allow 5000
```
